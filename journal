## Week 1
While completing the homework this I what I wrote down for these questions:
1. Asked AI to explain “f-string”
5. Had AI explain why .strip() is helpful in this specific context
14. Explained the max(days_until_due, 1)
      Asked Ai how to make a version that handles negative days as well
21. Asked for clarification on why I added “--status recorded” on the sam line and how it prevented using “if statements”
30. Asked AI if my code was the most efficient way given my current knowledge
Still unaware of my group, who’s in it, and what our project will be. 
Looking forward to this week’s lecture 

## Week 2
While completing the homework this I what I wrote down for these questions:
6. Forgot to add a double = within my "if" condition 
for status in available:
    if status = False:   # ❌ mistake: using = instead of ==
        count = count + 1
6. Forgot to captialized the "N" in Networks. Python is case-sensitive, so "network" does not match "Networks", which will raise a ValueError.
Asked AI to explain why python is case-sensitive and SQL isn't 
14. Asked ChatGPT how I would code the answer to this problem using a max key instead of a loop
29. Originally I made I mistake in my "for pos in positions". Afer looking it up, it's called "using the wrong modulo condition"
It looked like this: 
for pos in positions:
    if pos % 2 == 1:  # ❌ mistake: reverses even/odd labeling
Have my group now and just finished our charter
